# Cube Blend 
A blender addon to import Gaussian cube files and atomic XYZ files. Requires 
-[atomic simulation environment](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/) and
-[scikit-image](http://scikit-image.org/). 

It can be a bit tricky to install these as blender uses its own bundled python. If you install one of these packages and yet blender can't seem to find it, [check the answers here to install in the right place](https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/56011/how-to-use-pip-with-blenders-bundled-python/56013#56013).

Once you have those installed, you can use these folders as regular blender addons. They are added from the [user preferences as can be seen here](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/preferences/addons.html).
